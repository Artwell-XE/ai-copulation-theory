# ai-copulation-theory
This open-source project explores the computational theory of AI copulation and hybridization, focusing on breeding artificial intelligence as self-sustaining populations. The theory introduces an extended agent tuple to define each AI entity within the simulation and presents both classical and quantum mating kernels for genetic recombination.
